# Food Delivery Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook created as part of a food delivery data analysis task. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the process of integrating data from multiple sources and performing basic analytical operations to derive meaningful insights.

## Problem Statement
The task involves working with food delivery data provided in different formats:
- Orders data in CSV format
- User data in JSON format
- Restaurant data stored in a SQL database

The goal is to load these datasets, merge them into a single consolidated dataset, and perform analysis based on the final merged data.

## Approach
The notebook follows these steps:
1. Load data from CSV, JSON, and SQL sources
2. Merge datasets using appropriate keys
3. Create a final dataset that acts as a single source of truth
4. Perform basic analysis such as revenue aggregation and membership-based insights

## Analysis Highlights
- Order and revenue trends
- User behavior patterns
- Membership impact (Gold vs Regular)
- City-wise and cuisine-wise performance
- Revenue distribution insights

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- SQLite
- Jupyter Notebook

## File Structure
- `food_delivery_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing data loading, merging, and analysis steps

## Note
This notebook is created to demonstrate understanding of data integration and analysis concepts as per the task requirements.# Food-Delivery-Analysis
